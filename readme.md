**TableNET - Implementation**
This repo contains the code for TableNet implementation. 
Read the Paper here: [TableNet Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8978013)

The Saved Model Checkpoints and the DenseNet121 Pre-trained Weights can be found here:

Unfortunately, due to how heavy the model is, the model has so far been trained only upto 300 epochs. However, wwe will upload more rigorouslyy 
trained checkpoints in the future, following a similarly trained model as the original paper. 

**Unlike the original paper who tested it against ICDAR2013, we tested the model against ICDAR2019 Table dataset.**
ICDAR2019 dataset contains 2030 table images with PASCAL VOC format annotations. We as the original paper, picked 34 images and annotated XMLs and then extracted the data and predicted using the trained model weights.
More info can be found in the ![Test Notebook]('Model Implementations/model_testing_note.ipynb')

Some keynotes regarding the changes we had to made from the original repo:
- Install required libraries following requirements.txt
    - Some of the libraries no longer exist or are backdated and threw an error.
    - I.e: Sklearn is now scikit-learn
    - Changed requirements.txt file to accommodate the changes in the library name.
    - efficientnet_pytorch - was not mentioned in the requirements.txt however, is required to run the code.
- Running the Training:
    - Needed to change all the directories within the path_constants.py file to match that of our local drive.
- Running the Tests:
    - Needed to install tesseract OCR in local pc and specify the executable file path in the python code :
        - pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'/opt/homebrew/bin/tesseractâ€™
    - PIL -> Image.ANTIALIAS method has been removed from the library after PIL 10.0 update, which is necessary for testing our model. We can now use PIL.Image.Resampling.LANCZOS
- Added additional scripts for testing the model against ICDAR2019
